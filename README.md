# Gallertoid

This is the repo for gallertoid. Quite a bit of it is specialized for OpenShift deployment but it shouldn't be super hard to fix it up for running elsewhere.

Gallertoid is going to be a highly experimental web game based on GoKrida or Moe'uhane with a Box2D/Spore twist. A lot of the appeal of this sort of thing is information hiding, speculation, and gossip, so I won't get into the specifics here.

It's named after the 'gallertoid hypothesis' of metazoan evolution. In principle the first multicellular lifeform was just a blob of cells that took to being friends and floated around in the ancient ocean eating things. Cells on the outside expanded until they met their neighbors, cells in the middle tried to migrate to the outside. The result: a slimeball with a thin 'skin'. Ripples lead to dimples lead to canals lead to the protostomes, jellyfish, hydra, sponges, et cetera. Later, a second hole develops and everything else evolves from that. I'd like to be able to trace that process, more or less.
